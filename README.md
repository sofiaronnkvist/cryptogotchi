# Code Review

Done by [Amanda Karlsson Printz](https://github.com/amandaprintz).

1. `style.css:151-157` - Remember to think about not mixing different naming conventions such as camelCase and kebab-case. Overall kebab-case is the main naming convention in this project but in these rows camelCase is used which might confuse.
1. `style.css:1-28` - The CSS file is a bit long and contains all of the CSS. By splitting up the files and sorting, it would make the code more structured and easy to navigate. Maybe split into global-, fonts-, tamagotchi-style files.
1. `index.html: 34` - In this image it could‚Äôve had a bit more descriptive alt-text to explain the shape of the Tamagotchi‚Äôs and it's colors to maintain an accessible site that anyone despite variations can visit.
1. `index.html` - Maybe add a short intro-paragraph to introduce the site and it‚Äôs features. Right now you can‚Äôt really guess what‚Äôs possible to do with this site without seeing the code. The intro could be something like ‚ÄúYour Tamagotchi to care for your crypos! Click, scroll or press the navigation keys to explore what your Tamagotchi can do!‚Äù
1. `index.html:35-39` - To make it more clear that the buttons are clickable maybe add a hover-effect. It could be a hover-effect by changing the shadows that‚Äôs already there or changing the color of the actual button.
1. Overall a very fun and nostalgic game that also looks great design-wise with the colors and the overall style of it! üôÇ
